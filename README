This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3473

!! Only for Vim without GUI.

This light color scheme tries to remain coherent in different programming languages.

It is specially optimized for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, C, Python, Ruby and XML.

Note that the .Xdefaults/.Xresources configuration is included within the script.

For better results, paste this config in your .Xdefaults/.Xresources file (don't forget to remove the quotes ;-) )...

Enjoy!
